2.  install TestRPC and Web3js

NOTE: This website misspells ethereum.  On Step 2, it says to run "npm install -g etherumjs-testrpc".  This should be "npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc".  Then on Linux I had to run "npm init" to create the package.json file.  I then ran "npm install ganache-cli", which is what the prompt on this screen instructed me to do.  Run "npm install -d".

The testrpc command still would not run.  I Googled it and found "npm install web3" on the official documentation site @ https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/getting-started.html.
